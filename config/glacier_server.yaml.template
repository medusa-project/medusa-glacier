#server and amqp stanzas are mandatory for a SimpleAmqpServer
server:
  name: my_server_name
  allow_deletion: false
amqp:
  #queues for communication to and from caller. As expected, receive on incoming_queue and send result on outgoing_queue
  incoming_queue: medusa_to_glacier
  outgoing_queue: glacier_to_medusa
  #Connection information, passed directly to Bunny.new, whose defaults are used for anything missing
  #Note that Bunny will want these as symbols, so the YAML should reflect that
  connection:
    :port: 5672
#SimpleAmqpServerConfig may be subclassed and additional stanzas added here and used in the subclass for
#specific configuration that is needed.

#don't seem to affect the MRI bagit executable. Note that probably this should point to a script that then invokes
#bagit as desired.
